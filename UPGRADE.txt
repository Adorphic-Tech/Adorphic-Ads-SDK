Upgrading
=========

Complete details of how to upgrade your existing OpenX installation can be
found at http://www.openx.org/docs/. You should check this site for the
latest available details on how to upgrade. However, for convenience, the
upgrade process is essentially:

1) Copy your existing installation directory to a backup location.

2) Remove your existing installation directory.

3) Unpack the new version of OpenX into the same directory name as
   your previous installation.

4) Copy your config file from the backup location to the var/ directory
   of the newly unpacked installation.

5) Use a web browser to visit your OpenX site, and follow the instructions
   in the upgrade wizard to complete the upgrade.
