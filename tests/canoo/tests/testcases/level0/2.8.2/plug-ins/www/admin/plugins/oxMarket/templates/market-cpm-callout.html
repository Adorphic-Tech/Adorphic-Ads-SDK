    <p>
        The minimum CPM you provide here will be the floor price OpenX Market uses
        for all your existing remnant campaigns. If the highest bid from OpenX Market
        exceeds your floor price, OpenX Market will serve the ad and pay you
        the higher revenue. Otherwise, your campaign's existing ad will be delivered.
    </p>
    <p>
        We recommend that you specify a CPM that represents the effective CPM that
        you expect to get from your remnant campaigns.
