        Companion positioning is a way of ensuring that when one banner on a page is from a campaign, then all banners on the page will be from the same campaign. So, for example, imagine your web site has two zones on every page, and an advertiser says to you that they would like to advertise on your site, but only if they can have their banners in the two zones show up at the same time. This is when you want to use companion positioning.<br /><span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">Warning!</span><br />Before use this, check the<br/>Inventory › Advertisers menu › Miscellaneous: "Display only one banner from this advertiser on a web page" checkbox setting!
